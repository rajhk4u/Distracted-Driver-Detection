# Distracted-Driver-Detection
– The task is to detect if the car driver is driving safely or performing any other activity. The data set contained 10
different classes based on driver activity. We wanted to compare and learn implementation of different models.
– Implemented traditional ML models- PCA and Autoencoder to reduce dimensions and classification using KNN
classifier. Also built a custom CNN model.
– Observed an issue of Data leakage and found a solution to avoid it.
